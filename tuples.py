#tuples exercise
cities = ("London", "New York", "Berlin")
print(cities)

#check the type of data in the tuples
print(type(cities))
#question - why does it tell us the sequence type and not the text type

#check the index
print(cities.count("London"))

#example of an if statement
if "London" in cities :
    print("Oxford street")
